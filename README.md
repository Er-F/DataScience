## Content Overview

In this repository, you'll find:

1. **Data Preparation**: Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
2. **Model Definition**: A list of machine learning models used in the comparison.
3. **Training and Prediction**: The process of training the models and making predictions.
4. **Visualization**: Methods to visualize and compare the performance of different models.
5. **Feature Importance**: Analysis of feature importance to understand the impact of different variables.

## Main Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

Involves Data cleaning and splitting it into training and test sets. This step ensures that the data is ready for modeling and helps in achieving accurate results.

### 2. Model Definition

A variety of machine learning models are defined and stored for comparison. These models include:

- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
- ElasticNet
- Random Forest

### 3. Training and Prediction

Each model is trained on the training set and used to make predictions on the test set. This step helps in evaluating the performance of each model on unseen data.

### 4. Visualization

The predictions from all models are visualized to provide a clear comparison. Custom plotting functions are used to create subplots that display the actual vs. predicted values for each model, along with their RÂ² scores.

### 5. Feature Importance

Feature importance is analyzed using permutation importance. This analysis helps in understanding which features have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.

## Conclusion

This repository offers a comprehensive approach to comparing different machine learning models. By following the steps outlined, you can easily train, test, and visualize the performance of various models on your dataset. This comparison can help select the most suitable model for your specific application.
